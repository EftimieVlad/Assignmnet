New information RSS feeds, rome library

Estimated elapsed time 7-8 hours

Workflow

This app has a schaduled function that reads rss feeds from  http://feeds.nos.nl/nosjournaal?format=xml ( is is hardcoded ).
Everytime a new feed (title and date are unique) is found is added to the database.
Imformation is provided at the endpoint /feed/all (get request) and it return all the information in raw format ( images are bytes )


Improvments

Give more options to the client ( select just some feeds by hour/title)
Unit/acceptance tests for images, rss link feed and format
Better information caching ( in memory at this time )
